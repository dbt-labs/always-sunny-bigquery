# Always Sunny: dbt-bigquery

This project is used to exercise the functionality of `dbt-bigquery`.
It is loosely based on the generic [jaffle-shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) project,
but has been modified and will continue to diverge over time.
This project is intended to be used while developing or for performing end to end tests.
While this project may be a good source of examples of using `dbt-bigquery`,
it is not intended to be used for best practices.
Please see our [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com) for more information on using `dbt-bigquery`.
